# SynthEd

#### An educational app for sound synthesis

**SynthEd** is a web app for people who want to learn about synthesizers. The _finished_ app will lead users through the different elements of sound synthesis, from oscillators through to envelopes and filters.

The app is being built with React as it is useful to have parameters selected by the user stored in state as they change.

I will either use the sound library from p5.js or Tone.js to make sweet, sweet music.
